In my opinion, it won't be beneficial at all (maybe in memory(strongly in doubt)) 
For now, all method in stack has the complexity O(1), but if we would use queue as repsentation than either method push would have complexity
O(n) or both methods pop and top would have the complexity O(n), as it was anologically for queue using stack as representaion.
