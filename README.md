CS107(Intro to CS and Data Structures) Labs

This repository contains all labs Iâ€™ve done during Intro to CS and Data Structures. I coded mainly in python.
Lab 0 is about general geometrical problems about interception. 
Lab 1 was about the complexity of Fibonacci numbers and building the class points.
Lab 2 was about all types of sorting algorithms, such as Bubble, Selection, Merge, Counting, Quick Sort, and binary search. Besides, we examined the complexity of algorithms.
(Please follow the link for the Lab Report: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/115rENHBZqquPZcABz5h5UR1E5wl80etx?usp=share_link )
Lab 3 was about fundamental problems like palindromes and the difference between recursion from top to bottom and bottom to top.
Lab 4 was about creating data structures like list, stack, and queue. 
Lab 5 was about developing Binary Search Tree, getting Arithmetic Parse Tree from Postfix Expression and vice verse
Lab 6 was about developing a graph, and than use Graph Algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra to analyze information about students' course choices
